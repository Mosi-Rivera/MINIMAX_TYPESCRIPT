# MECHANICS
<ul>
  <li>Moving in a direction moves all the players pieces in that direction. When moving if a piece runs into an enemy piece of equal or less value that piece is eaten.</li>
  <li>Black tiles and allied tiles of any value or enemy tiles of greater value are treated as obstacles and will stop the movement of the piece.</li>
  <li>When a piece is removed from the board it is put on cooldown. Each turn that cooldown is reduced by one. When the pieces cooldown is reduced to zero it can be deployed.</li>
</ul>

# HOW TO PLAY?
<ul>
  <li>The player is in control of the blue tiles and pieces and the bot controls the red tiles and pieces.</li>
  <li>Hover the board and select a movement direction. All pieces on the board will be move in that direction.</li>
  <li>Every turn pieces come closer to being unlocked. When pieces are unlocked click on them and then on a blue tile to deploy them.</li>
</ul>

# WIN CONDITIONs
<ul>
  <li>Fill more than 70% of the board with blue tiles. The bars on the right of the board show how close each player is to winning this way.</li>
  <li>Remove all of the bots pieces from the board.</li>
</ul>
